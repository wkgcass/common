Version 0.0.0

Let your class extends AutoWire, then simply 
"new" the class, you can get all members injected

You can use this tool with Struts2, Spring,actually
it is able to work with all kinds of frameworks.

Note that
Circular dependency may not function well.
Classes which occurs circular dependency must 
be singletons.
And one millisecond must be wait or sleep for after 
constructing finished in order to let the injection 
complete, otherwise you may get a null value.

Also, multiple-thread environment haven't been 
strictly handled (only some basic measures taken),
use with care.

There are some logical faults i am already aware.
But I will try to fix these problems in later versions.



Version 0.1.0

Listener for 8 main methods in IOCController is provided
You can implement IOCListener and register the implementation to IOCController to use.
Also a DefaultIOCListener is provided, which contains empty methods, with which the coding would be neater.
