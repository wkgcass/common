# cass.toolbox.ioc
This package contains tools that can help you
<br/>with 'inversion of control'. 
<br/>Though Spring can do dependency injection, 
<br/>and have done very well, but the complexity 
<br/>of configuring Spring is a little high. It took 
<br/>me an entire day to learn how bean works.
<br/>
<br/>Actually, in some small projects, we don't need
<br/>so many functions provided by Spring, what we
<br/>want is injecting members. Best solution would
<br/>be simply using <b>"new"</b>, then all injection are done.
<br/>
<br/>This tool provide you a way of using <b>"new"</b> to 
<br/>complete dependency injection.
